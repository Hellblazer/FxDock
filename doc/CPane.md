# CPane

CPane is an FX Pane implementation that combines BorderPane and a table layout similar to GridPane.  
The grid (or, rather, table) layout is similar to my Swing
[CPanel](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/PasswordSafe/blob/master/src/goryachev/common/ui/CPanel.java), 
which in turn was inspired by 
[Table Layout](http://www.clearthought.info/)
